WEB DEVELOPEMNT WITH DJANGO

Throughout this book, we will be building a book review website named Bookr. It will allow you to add fields for publishers, contributors, books, and reviews. A publisher will publish one or more books, and each book will have one or more contributors (author, editor, co-author, and so on). Only admin users will be allowed to modify these fields. Once a user has signed up for an account on the site, they will be able to start adding reviews to a book.
